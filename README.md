# Iris-Flower-Classification

#### **📌 Objective:**  
The goal of this project is to classify **Iris flower species** (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width** using **Machine Learning**.  

---

#### **📂 Dataset:**  
- The dataset contains **150 samples** of three Iris species.  
- Features: **Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width**  
- Target: **Species name (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)**  

---

#### **📊 Machine Learning Model Used:**  
✅ **Random Forest Classifier** (100 decision trees)  
✅ Splitting data into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)**  
✅ **Label Encoding** to convert species names into numerical values  

---

#### **📌 Features Implemented:**  
✔ **Train a Random Forest model** for classification  
✔ **Feature Importance Analysis** to see which features matter the most  
✔ **Real-time user input** to classify a new flower  
✔ **Ensured feature name consistency** to prevent errors  

---

#### **🔍 Key Learnings:**  
- **Random Forest** works well for classification tasks.  
- **Petal dimensions** are more important than sepal dimensions for classification.  
- **Handling user input correctly** ensures accurate predictions.  

---

#### **🚀 Final Outcome:**  
The trained model can accurately **predict the Iris species** based on user input, making it a **practical ML application**! 🎯🌸
